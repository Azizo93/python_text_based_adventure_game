# text_based_adventure_game - Python
This game is my first attempt at intergrating the various techniques I have learnt during my 'Intro to Python' lessons into one functional application.
The purpsoe of this game is to demonstrate my python OOP coding ability.
I have used OOP - Classes & Sub-Classes to create the game allowing players to interact with characters and objects. As they progress through the story they are required to recall objects to allow them to progress further. 
Further work is required to remove any redundent code.
